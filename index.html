The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) is the apex
body concerning all aspects of refinement of School Education. It has recently
developed textual material in Chemistry for Higher Secondary stage which is
based on the National Curriculum Framework (NCF)–2005. NCF recommends
that children’s experience in school education must be linked to the life outside
school so that learning experience is joyful and fills the gap between the experience
at home and in community. It recommends to diffuse the sharp boundaries
between different subjects and discourages rote learning. The recent development
of syllabi and textual material is an attempt to implement this basic idea. The
present laboratory manual will be complementary to the textbook of Chemistry
for Class XI. It is in continuation to the NCERT’s efforts to improve upon
comprehension of concepts and practical skills among students. The purpose of
this manual is not only to convey the approach and philosophy of the practical
course to students and teachers but to provide them appropriate guidance for
carrying out experiments in the laboratory. The manual is supposed to encourage
children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue further activities and
questions. Of course the success of this effort also depends on the initiatives to
be taken by the principals and teachers to encourage children to carry out
experiments in the laboratory and develop their thinking and nurture creativity.
The methods adopted for performing the practicals and their evaluation will
determine how effective this practical book will prove to make the children’s life
at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress and boredom. The
practical book attempts to provide space to opportunities for contemplation and
wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on
experience. It is hoped that the material provided in this manual will help students
in carrying out laboratory work effectively and will encourage teachers to
introduce some open-ended experiments at the school level.
